# AMFramework
Is a framework used for simulating and mapping material properties when subjected to heat treatments and/or change in element composition. Additionally the framework offers various tools for analizing all generated data nodes.

Calculations are made using external CALPHAD software (e.g. Matcalc), and it is important to keep in mind that this framework does not provide any license.
